      {
        "question": "Can you guarantee stable publication? When is it updated?",
        "answer": "Our newsletter is mainly published on Saturdays Beijing time, occasionally on Sundays. We will skip one issue during China's National Day and Spring Festival holidays, with an estimated 50 issues published annually."
      },
      {
        "question": "I'm a Python beginner/senior developer, is this newsletter suitable for me?",
        "answer": "Our content covers all skill levels: beginners can find basic tutorials and starter projects; intermediate developers can get practical tools and best practices; advanced developers can learn about cutting-edge technologies and in-depth analysis. Whether you're a student, working programmer, or technical manager, you'll benefit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the paid version offer compared to the free version? Is it worth subscribing?",
        "answer": "The paid version includes complete content links, recommendations, and screenshots, while the free version is a simplified title-only version. Newly published newsletters are paid content, but historical newsletters become freely available to all readers after more than one year."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the features of the newsletter e-book? How to get it?",
        "answer": "Every 30 issues of the newsletter form a season and are compiled into multi-format collection e-books. Newly completed e-books are exclusive benefits for paid readers, but e-books from over a year ago are completely free. You can get download links by sending 'W30' to our WeChat official account."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I recommend quality content to the newsletter?",
        "answer": "Absolutely welcome! You can submit issues on GitHub to recommend articles, projects, resources, or information sources. We encourage both self-recommendations and recommendations of others, and welcome you to participate in building a quality newsletter together."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why can't some links in the newsletter be opened?",
        "answer": "This might be due to source website failures or deleted source content, especially for content shared in very early newsletters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you provide full article text instead of just brief recommendations?",
        "answer": "Constantly jumping through links to access source content is indeed inconvenient and not conducive to article collection and knowledge management. I've actually considered including all articles in a Notion knowledge base for easier reader search, collection, and review of historical content. But this involves copyright issues, maintenance costs, and impacts on subscription pricing. Feel free to message me with your thoughts and needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does subscribing to the newsletter help my career development?",
        "answer": "Our newsletter provides four core values:\n① Technical Vision Expansion - Stay ahead of the latest Python ecosystem trends and maintain technical acuity\n② Project Inspiration - Discover cutting-edge open source projects and practical tools that provide innovative ideas for your work and projects\n③ Learning Path Optimization - Curated high-quality tutorials and best practices to help you efficiently improve your technical skills\n④ Industry Insight Deepening - Master Python's development trajectory in hot fields like AI, data science, and web development"
      },
      {
        "question": "When will you support subscription platforms like Substack?",
        "answer": "Currently, platforms like Substack only support Stripe or Paypal for payment processing, which presents challenges for Chinese individual creators due to unfriendly identity verification requirements and various payment restrictions. I'm actively researching solutions to these payment processing issues and will promptly update and expand to new platforms once viable alternatives become available. Thank you for your patience and continued support."
