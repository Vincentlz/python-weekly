1„ÄÅ[NumPy 2.0: A Major Milestone](https://blog.scientific-python.org/numpy/numpy2/)

It's been 18 years since NumPy 1.0 was released, and version 2.0 marks a major milestone. It introduces some breaking changes with significant upgrades: cleaned up and simplified Python API, updated scalar promotion rules, powerful DType API and new string dtype, enhanced Windows compatibility, and support for the Python Array API standard. (Also see: [NumPy 2.0.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v2.0.0))

2„ÄÅ[Python Language Summit 2024: Should Python Adopt Calendar Versioning?](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/python-language-summit-2024-should-python-adopt-calver.html)

Last year we covered all Python Language Summit topics in [a special edition](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-05-31-weekly4), this year we're picking just three highlights - check the [official blog](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/python-language-summit-2024.html) for more. This topic discusses switching Python from its current semantic versioning (SemVer) to calendar versioning (CalVer), incorporating the year into version numbers - like 3.26 for a version released in 2026. Alternative formats include year-focused "26.0.0" and year-plus-month "26.10.0".

3„ÄÅ[Python Language Summit 2024: Should We Make pdb Better?](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/python-language-summit-2024-pyrepl-new-pdb.html)

One of this year's Python Language Summit topics, presented by @Gaotian who recently became a core developer from China. The discussion covered potential new features for pdb, including displaying code around breakpoints, syntax highlighting in terminals, customization support, and handling more scenarios (threading, async, bytecode, remote debugging). It also proposed switching pdb's underlying implementation to `sys.monitoring` for better performance, though this would introduce backward compatibility issues.

4„ÄÅ[Python Language Summit 2024: Python on Mobile](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/python-language-summit-2024-python-on-mobile.html)

Another topic from this year's Python Language Summit, discussing the current state and future direction of Python on mobile platforms like iOS and Android. Python 3.13 provides Tier 3 support for Python on Android and iOS. The BeeWare team is pushing to bring the Python open-source package ecosystem to mobile platforms, with increased investment in CPython test suites and build tools.

5„ÄÅ[Python Project Management Primer](https://martynassubonis.substack.com/p/python-project-management-primer)

6„ÄÅ[Joining Strings in Python: An "Aha" Moment](https://berglyd.net/blog/2024/06/joining-strings-in-python/)

The author has been using Python for 17 years - what could possibly make her go "aha"? While studying `str.join()`, she discovered something weird: using a generator as input to `str.join()` performs about 16% slower than using a list comprehension. The reason? `join()` first converts the generator to a list before concatenating, causing extra overhead. PyPy doesn't do this conversion - it's actually about 5x faster with generators than list comprehensions.

7„ÄÅ[Mastering Context Managers: Simplifying Python Resource Management](https://coderlegion.com/361/mastering-context-manager-simplifying-resource-management-python)

When working with resources, you often need to handle repetitive tasks like setting up and tearing down processes, opening and closing resources. Context managers are perfect for these scenarios. This article covers what context managers are, detailed usage guides, typical use cases, and common pitfalls.

8„ÄÅ[How to Move from Pandas to Polars](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/06/how-to-move-from-pandas-to-polars/)

The high-performance Rust-built Polars is eating into Pandas' market share. Is migrating from Pandas to Polars a hassle? Will it break your data processing workflows and tools? The author demonstrates a seamless transition process.

9„ÄÅ[Adding a JIT Compiler to CPython](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/977855/5daef5af6b2d4c1b/)

This is a written report on a PyCon 2024 talk by Brandt Bucher, who introduced the JIT compiler to Python 3.13. It covers the series of improvements made before Python 3.13, why they decided to introduce a JIT compiler in 3.13, the team's current work, and core implementation details.

10„ÄÅ[Debug Log: CPython GH-120437](https://www.manjusaka.blog/posts/2024/06/19/a-live-debug-gh120437/)

The article shares the author's experience debugging a bug in Python 3.13 Beta, involving the newly introduced JIT/Tier 2 optimizer module.

11„ÄÅ[Parsing Python ASTs 20x Faster with Rust](https://www.gauge.sh/blog/parsing-python-asts-20x-faster-with-rust)

The author used the `tach` library (featured in issue #53) to analyze 3000 files, which took nearly 10 seconds. The article analyzes what was causing the slowdown, then rewrites the C code in Rust, achieving nearly 20x speedup. Performance profiling tools used include py-spy, speedscope, and Valgrind.

12„ÄÅ[Ruff: Internals of a Rust-Backed Python Linter-Formatter](https://compileralchemy.substack.com/p/ruff-internals-of-a-rust-backed-python)

This is the first article in a series attempting to decode Ruff's internal implementation, covering how Rust and Python interoperate, how Ruff's first version worked, and what components make up the current version.
