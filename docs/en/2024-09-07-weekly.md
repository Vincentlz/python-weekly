8„ÄÅ[The Design & Implementation of the CPython Virtual Machine](https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/cpython-vm-internals)

A deep dive into the design and implementation of the CPython virtual machine, including bytecode format, the interpreter's bytecode evaluation loop, and how stack frames and computed jumps are used to optimize performance. Finally, it analyzes the execution process of a simple Python program, showing how the VM manages and executes compiled bytecode.

9„ÄÅ[How we made querying Pandas DataFrames with chDB 87x faster](https://clickhouse.com/blog/chdb-pandas-dataframes-87x-faster)

chDB is an embedded version of ClickHouse that runs in-process. Its version 2.0 is 87x faster than 1.0 when querying Pandas DataFrames. The article explains how this was achieved: reducing serialization/deserialization steps, directly reading Python objects, batch data copying, and rewriting Python string encoding/decoding logic in C++.

10„ÄÅ[Escaping from Anaconda's Stranglehold on macOS](https://paulromer.net/escaping-from-anaconda/)

Beginners who install Anaconda on macOS might not be able to find a way to run the official Python. The article introduces a simple solution: moving the .zshrc file out of the home directory to escape Anaconda's control over the Python environment.

11„ÄÅ[Python: profile total memory allocated with tracemalloc](https://adamj.eu/tech/2024/08/30/python-profile-total-memory-tracemalloc/)

`tracemalloc` is a Python standard library that can track memory allocation. The article shows how to use it to implement a simple memory estimation function, compares it with sys.getsizeof(), and examines the memory size of importing numpy. (Also: [What should you pay attention to when Python calculates memory?](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2020-03-02-size))

12„ÄÅ[Habits of great software engineers](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/habits-of-great-software-engineers)
