# Python Trending Weekly #43: Choosing Family Over Open Source

Hey Python enthusiasts! üêç 

I'm your host, and this is where we share top-quality Python, AI, and tech content every week - mostly in English. This newsletter is open source, so feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/chinesehuazhou/python-weekly). We also have a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/pythontrendingweekly) as our supplement, sharing even more resources - definitely worth following!

**Special Note:** This week we're giving away 5 copies of "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python (3rd Edition)" - details at the end!

## ü¶Ñ Articles & Tutorials

1„ÄÅ[My Shifting Open Source Priorities](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2024/03/17/my-shifting-open-source-priorities/)

The author has open-sourced multiple Python projects including `PyOxidizer` and `python-build-standalone`. However, with his programming interests shifting toward Rust and his new roles as husband and father taking up time and energy, he's choosing to prioritize family and is looking for new maintainers for these open source projects.

2„ÄÅ[Waking my computer from afar](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/wakeonlan/)

How do you remotely wake up your home computer when it's in sleep mode? The author used a Raspberry Pi single-board computer + a simple Python web page + systemd service to send data packets to the computer's network controller, achieving remote machine wake-up.

3„ÄÅ[The memory footprint of your Python application](https://codebeez.nl/blogs/the-memory-footprint-of-your-python-application/)

Compared to statically typed languages, Python consumes a lot of memory. This article explores Python's memory model: how objects are allocated, where they're stored, and how they're eventually cleaned up. It introduces simple techniques to significantly improve memory usage.

4„ÄÅ[Regex character "$" doesn't mean "end-of-string"](https://sethmlarson.dev/regex-$-matches-end-of-string-or-newline)

What does the "$" symbol match in regular expressions? How does Python's `re.MULTILINE` mode affect string matching? Do different programming languages behave the same way? When should you use "\z" and "\Z"?

5„ÄÅ[Every dunder method in Python](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/every-dunder-method/)

Dunder methods are special methods that start and end with double underscores, like `__init__()`. Python has over 150 special dunder methods. This article categorizes and provides a comprehensive list of them.

6„ÄÅ[Python Multi-language Support: Best Practices for Internationalization and Localization](https://juejin.cn/post/7348264185325568036)

Python has rich libraries for internationalization and localization support. This article explains how to use the `gettext` library for language internationalization and how to manage localization resources.

7„ÄÅ[Building a ChatGPT-style Q&A Assistant with Qwen Large Model on Windows](https://juejin.cn/post/7347670979634167823)

Qwen is a large language model released by Alibaba. The author built a Qwen-based AI Q&A assistant on a Win10 system. The content includes environment setup, model downloading, and using `transformers` to implement model conversation functionality.

8„ÄÅ[(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](https://www.norvig.com/lispy.html)

"If you don't know how compilers work, then you don't know how computers work." The author develops a Lisp interpreter using Python, providing detailed coverage of Scheme syntax and deep exploration of how interpreters/computers work.

9„ÄÅ[Parsing URLs in Python](https://tkte.ch/articles/2024/03/15/parsing-urls-in-python.html)

Correctly parsing URLs is harder than you might think - they've changed dramatically since being introduced in 1994. Python's standard library `urllib` doesn't follow any URL specification. This article introduces two WHATWG-compliant parsing libraries: `ada-python` and `can_ada`. The latter is 2x faster than the former, and the former is 2x faster than `urllib.parse`.

10„ÄÅ[Duck Typing in Python: Writing Flexible and Decoupled Code](https://realpython.com/duck-typing-python/)

The core idea of duck typing is "if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck." Type is determined by an object's behavior, not by rigid definitions. This comprehensive article provides detailed coverage of duck typing: what it is, how to use it, its pros and cons, and solutions to address duck typing's shortcomings.

11„ÄÅ[Pretending to be PostgreSQL with Python](https://ivdl.co.za/2024/03/02/pretending-to-be-postgresql-part-one-1/)

Introduces the communication flow between PostgreSQL server and client, implementing a minimal server using Python.

12„ÄÅ[Building for Builders](https://deven.codes/posts/building-for-builders/)

The author developed two Python frameworks last year. This article shares what he learned while building frameworks. Some advice includes: define your anti-goals, understand what already exists, think interface-first, use it before it's ready, one sample isn't enough, prioritize documentation, etc.
