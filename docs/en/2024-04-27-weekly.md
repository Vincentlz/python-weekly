2„ÄÅ[Ruby vs Python: For Loops](https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2021/11/12/ruby-vs-python-for-loop.html)

Both Ruby and Python are leaders among scripting languages, with many differences between them. This article analyzes the deep design philosophy differences between the two languages through the seemingly small syntax point of for loops. (Note: This is an old article from 2021 that suddenly went viral this week. I happened to translate it in 2021, welcome to read the Chinese version [Comparing Python and Ruby Programming Philosophy Through For Loops](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2021-11-23-ruby))

3„ÄÅ[Python Gotcha: Strip Functions Remove More Than Expected](https://andrewwegner.com/python-gotcha-strip-functions-unexpected-behavior.html)

From the "Python Gotcha" series, this briefly introduces the unexpected behavior of these three string functions, which indeed goes against intuition. Python 3.9's removesuffix() and removeprefix() can correctly remove left and right strings.

4„ÄÅ[Core Mechanisms of Inter-Process Communication Explained with Python](https://goodyduru.github.io/os/2023/09/08/ipc-introduction.html)

This is a series of articles about IPC (Inter-Process Communication), introducing different mechanisms provided by Unix operating systems and demonstrating with Python code. Topics include named pipes, Unix domain sockets, Unix signals, message queues, shared memory, memory-mapped files, etc.

5„ÄÅ[PEP 745 ‚Äì Python 3.14 Release Schedule](https://peps.python.org/pep-0745/)

Python 3.13 development work is nearing completion, with new feature integration freezing next month and planned release on October 1st this year. Python 3.14 development will officially begin on May 7th. The official release schedule for version 3.14 has been announced, with the final version expected to be released on October 1st next year. (Coincidentally both on our National Day!)

6„ÄÅ[Time Complexities of Different Python Data Structures](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/time-complexities/)

Time complexity is used to evaluate algorithm performance efficiency. As data scale increases, algorithms with lower time complexity are more efficient. The article introduces time complexities of various Python data structures, such as lists, queues, dictionaries, sets, counters, heaps/priority queues, sorted lists, etc.

7„ÄÅ[Understanding Django from First Principles](https://www.mostlypython.com/django-from-first-principles-2/)

This is a series of articles, currently updated to 3 parts, planning to build a complete Django project starting from a single file. When newcomers encounter Django development, they only need two commands to start a complete new project, but this lacks understanding of Django. This series gradually adds files to help you master necessary knowledge.

8„ÄÅ[Python Thread Pool Source Code Analysis and Related Issues](https://juejin.cn/post/7361234872781029388)

ThreadPoolExecutor is Python's official thread pool implementation. The article analyzes related source code implementation to understand thread pool architecture design, while exploring related issues like excessive memory usage caused by improper use.

9„ÄÅ[How to Design and Implement Plugin Architecture in Python?](https://mathieularose.com/plugin-architecture-in-python)

We deal with browser plugins and IDE plugins all day long. So, do you want to know how to design a plugin system with Python? The author uses their open-source utt library as an example to introduce implementing a simple plugin system.

10„ÄÅ[Brief Discussion on Exception Handling in Python, Go, and Rust](https://juejin.cn/post/7359757993732751375)

What are the exception handling approaches in Python, Go, and Rust? What are the pros and cons of their implementation solutions? The author's final conclusion is preferring Python's intuitive and simple handling approach. (Note: Our newsletter has featured three articles on this topic: [Four Error Handling Methods in Programming Languages](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2023-05-08-error), [Two Styles of Error Handling](https://frostming.com/error-handling/), [Python Errors as Values: Comparing Go and Rust Usage Patterns](https://www.inngest.com/blog/python-errors-as-values))

11„ÄÅ[Memory Management Design in mpmetrics](https://blog.trends.tf/memory-management-in-mpmetrics.html)

When programming in Python, you usually don't need to worry about how memory is allocated and reclaimed - it's all handled automatically. But in situations involving performance optimization, C language interaction, or processing large amounts of data, memory management can be an effective approach. The article introduces mpmetrics' memory management implementation, focusing on dynamic variable allocation based on shared memory.

12„ÄÅ[Origins and Advantages of Semicolons in Programming Languages](https://www.ntietz.com/blog/researching-why-we-use-semicolons-as-statement-terminators/)

Many programming languages use semicolons as statement terminators. The article attempts to explore the origins of this practice and discusses what advantages semicolons have over other symbols. (Note: Python is an exception, please check [Why Doesn't Python Use Semicolons as Terminators?](https://pythoncat.top/posts/2020-05-27-semicolons))
