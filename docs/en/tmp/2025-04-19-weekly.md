# Python Trending Weekly #98: CUDA Finally Adds Native Python Support!

Hey there! I'm Python Cat. Here I share quality Python, AI, and general tech content weekly, mostly in English. The newsletter is open source on [Github](https://github.com/chinesehuazhou/python-weekly) - if you like it, please give us a star! ‚≠ê

This week we're sharing 12 articles, 12 open source projects, and 2 podcasts/videos.

## [ü¶Ñ Articles & Tutorials](https://xiaobot.net/p/python_weekly)

1„ÄÅ[PEP 750 ‚Äì Template Strings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0750)

PEP-750 has been accepted and will be merged into Python 3.14! It proposes introducing t-strings that return a Template type instead of a string, suitable for custom string processing, web templates, DSLs, and other scenarios while avoiding security issues like SQL injection and XSS attacks. (Also: [PEP750 Template Strings Chinese Translation](https://www.cnblogs.com/hiyms/p/-/python-pep750-cn))

2„ÄÅ[PEP 787 ‚Äì Safer subprocess usage using t-strings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0787/)

This PEP proposes extending the `subprocess` and `shlex` modules to support template strings (t-strings), enabling safer and more convenient execution of shell commands with interpolation.

3„ÄÅ[Python at the Speed of Rust](https://blog.fxn.ai/python-at-the-speed-of-rust/)

Introduces how to compile Python code to native code, achieving performance close to Rust. Uses CPython's frame evaluation API to implement symbolic tracing, builds IR graphs, and then progressively lowers IR graphs to platform-specific native code.

4„ÄÅ[What happens if you write a TCP stack in Python?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/08/12/what-happens-if-you-write-a-tcp-stack-in-python/)

How to develop a simple TCP protocol stack using Python and scapy? The article analyzes the TCP three-way handshake process, implements its interaction mechanism through code, and demonstrates Python's speed limitations in network communication.

5„ÄÅ[14 Advanced Python Features](https://blog.edward-li.com/tech/advanced-python-features)

The article shares 14 advanced Python features with examples, including type overloading, generics, pattern matching, advanced f-strings, proxy properties, metaclasses, and more.

6„ÄÅ[Is Python Code Sensitive to CPU Caching?](https://lukasatkinson.de/2024/python-cpu-caching/)

Python doesn't support controlling memory layout of data structures - does this mean CPU caching has no impact on Python performance? After testing, the author found that random list access is 1.2-1.5 times slower than sequential access, indicating that cache optimization applies to interpreted languages as well.

7„ÄÅ[Use polars in 2025](https://lrt.one/posts/use-polars-in-2025/)

The author recommends using polars in data analysis projects because it offers better performance, more intuitive API design, and a more unified type system. The author also mentions two shortcomings of polars.

8„ÄÅ[Mastering DuckDB when you're used to pandas or Polars: part 2](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/duckdb-when-used-to-frames_part2)

The second part of a series introducing how to translate dataframe operations into SQL, including filtering with window functions, expression composition, and nested data types.

9„ÄÅ[Stop Writing `__init__` Methods](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/04/stop-writing-init-methods.html)

Recommends avoiding writing `__init__` methods to prevent redundancy, testing difficulties, and inflexibility issues. The author suggests using `dataclass` to auto-generate `__init__`, using `classmethod` as object factories, and strengthening type constraints through `NewType`.

10„ÄÅ[Maps with Django‚ÅΩ¬≥‚Åæ: GeoDjango, Pillow & GPS](https://www.paulox.net/2025/04/11/maps-with-django-part-3-geodjango-pillow-and-gps/)

Introduces how to extract GPS information from images using the Django web framework, GeoDjango module, and Pillow image library, then create web maps with images.

11„ÄÅ[Quick Primer on Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/MCP.html)

Provides an accessible introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP), demonstrating environment setup, practical operations using Python for MCP, and integration applications with other tools.

12„ÄÅ[From DeepSeek LLM to DeepSeek R1](https://oilbeater.com/2025/03/14/deepseek-from-llm-to-r1/)

The first part of a series attempting to trace DeepSeek's step-by-step exploration journey (DeepSeek LLM -> DeepSeek MoE -> DeepSeek V2 -> DeepSeek V3 -> DeepSeek R1), showcasing DeepSeek's unique approach to technical route selection and model optimization.
