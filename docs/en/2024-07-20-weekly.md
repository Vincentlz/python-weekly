Hey there! I'm Cat. Every week I curate and share high-quality Python, AI, and tech content - mostly in English. Don't forget to check out our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/pythontrendingweekly) for even more awesome updates!

This week we're featuring 12 articles, 12 open-source projects, 2 podcasts/videos, and 2 hot discussions.

## [ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials](https://xiaobot.net/p/python_weekly)

1„ÄÅ[ Binary secret scanning helped us prevent (what might have been) the worst supply chain attack you can imagine](https://jfrog.com/blog/leaked-pypi-secret-token-revealed-in-binary-preventing-suppy-chain-attack/)

JFrog's security team uncovered a PyPI admin key leak that could've been catastrophic - we're talking access to 200+ repositories across python, pypa, psf, and pypi organizations! The admin had hardcoded the key in source code and later removed it, but it lingered in cached pyc files. This shows that source code security scanning isn't enough - binary security scanning is equally crucial!

2„ÄÅ[Incident Report: Leaked GitHub Personal Access Token](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-07-08-incident-report-leaked-admin-personal-access-token/)

The PSF Infrastructure Director (the person involved in the previous incident) published an incident report revealing that the leaked key had been committed about a year ago - thankfully, it wasn't maliciously exploited! Key takeaways: set appropriate expiration times for tokens, exclude `__pycache__` and `*.pyc` files when building Docker images, and keep your source code clean.

3„ÄÅ[„ÄêNetwork Security„Äë„ÄåVulnerability Reproduction„Äç(Part 6) Exploring Prototype Chain Exploitation and Pollution in Python](https://juejin.cn/post/7390956576179585024)

From the "Learning Security Testing from 0 to 1" series, this article explores Python prototype chain exploitation and pollution through a Flask web app's server-side template injection attack. It helps readers understand prototype chain concepts, mechanisms, and potential security risks in Python.

4„ÄÅ[Free-threaded CPython is ready to experiment with! ](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/free-threaded-python-rollout)

Python 3.13 is dropping in just over 2 months - ready to experiment with the GIL-free feature? This article introduces the [free-threaded-compatibility](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/free-threaded-compatibility) repository, provides resources, and tracks open-source project support for no-GIL. It also covers two thread safety issues discovered in numpy and pywavelets.

5„ÄÅ[Several Methods for Python Performance Analysis: Finding That Special One in Your Code](https://juejin.cn/post/7390319395833380901)

Learn how to use the `profilehooks` library to detect Python code performance, then leverage `Snakeviz` and `gprof2dot` visualization tools to analyze data, identify major performance bottlenecks, and achieve effective optimization.

6„ÄÅ[Creating a Simple Pastebin Service in Python and Flask](https://muhammadraza.me/2024/Simple-Pastebin-In-Python/)

Pastebin is an online service for sharing code and text. This article shows how to build one with Flask, supporting text pasting, programming language selection, and shareable URL generation, with detailed explanations of each code component. (Fun coincidence: we also received a long-awaited open-source project submission this week - [a simple pastebin built with async Flask](https://github.com/yuxiaoy1/simple-pastebin), shared by @yuxiaoy1!)

7„ÄÅ[Debug noteÔºöCPython GH-121528](https://www.manjusaka.blog/posts/2024/07/16/a-live-debug-gh121528/)

@Manjusaka strikes again with another CPython bug fix! In Python 3.13 Beta, the PEP-683 implementation plus surrounding changes caused some extensions compiled under older versions to fail in Python 3.13.

8„ÄÅ[Sharing Something Interesting: I Helped Fix a CPython Bug](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/OURHYVaupSkfGvMYwAATVA)

@Âè§ÊòéÂú∞Ëßâ also fixed a CPython bug! It was about Python's tuple cache pool issue - the final code change was just adding an "=" sign, but the process of discovering and reproducing the issue from source code really deepens your understanding of the Python interpreter.

9„ÄÅ[How a Decorator Crashed My Flask App: Lessons Learned](https://suyogdahal.com.np/posts/how-decorator-crashed-my-flask-app/)

What should you watch out for when writing Python decorators? The article's answer: always use `functools.wraps` - without it, multiple decorator usage can cause naming conflicts.

10„ÄÅ[Proper Python Project Structure 2024](https://matt.sh/python-project-structure-2024)

The article argues that using `requirements.txt`, manually creating and entering venv virtual environments, manually setting `PYTHONPATH`, and using `setup.py` to build extensions are all bad practices. The author presents a poetry-based project management solution instead.

11„ÄÅ[Here‚Äôs how you can build and train GPT-2 from scratch using PyTorch](https://differ.blog/p/here-s-how-you-can-build-and-train-gpt-2-from-scratch-using-pytorch-ace4ba)
