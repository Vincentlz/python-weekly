## ü¶Ñ Articles & Tutorials

1„ÄÅ[I "Met" a Nobel Prize Winner](https://frostming.com/2024/meet-with-paul/)

What a role model! Our weekly regular @frostming was invited to meet with 2018 Nobel Prize co-winner Paul Romer because of developing PDM. The article shares this exciting experience, mentioning that Paul is working on a GUI application to help Python beginners set up development environments. I didn't expect him to care about such things - instantly gained my respect.

2„ÄÅ[Becoming a Python Core Developer in 450 Days](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1of421972c)

Another role model! @Gaotian spent just over a year contributing to CPython and has now officially become a Python core developer. There are currently fewer than 100 active core developers globally, making this achievement truly remarkable. (Related: This [nomination post for Gaotian](https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-promote-tian-gao/53895) details his contributions to Python)

3„ÄÅ[How Python Compares Floats and Ints?](https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/how-python-compares-floats-and-ints)

Starting with a very strange problem (see screenshot below), the article introduces IEEE-754 double precision format representation and dives deep into CPython interpreter source code to explain Python's algorithm for comparing floats and integers. Unlike C and Java which implicitly convert integers to double precision, Python has infinite precision integers, so it designed a specialized algorithm for comparison.
