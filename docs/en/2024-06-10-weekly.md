# Python Trending Weekly #55: 9 High-Quality Tech Info Sources You Need to Know!

Hey Python enthusiasts! üêç Ready to discover some game-changing resources that'll supercharge your development journey?

I've been reading Python newsletters for years, and I wanted to share the ones that have actually been worth my time. After testing 9 different newsletters, I've got some thoughts on which ones deliver real value and which ones... well, let's just say your inbox deserves better.

Here's my honest take on each one, ranked from the newsletters I actually look forward to reading down to the ones I'd probably unsubscribe from. If you're tired of sifting through mediocre content, this might help you find something worthwhile.

## 1. Python Trending Weekly

This newsletter started in May 2023 and combines AI filtering with human curation. Each issue includes 12 articles/tutorials and 12 projects, sourced from 400+ Python-related sites. They also cover podcasts, videos, and community discussions.

What I like: Instead of just dropping links, they actually write descriptions and include screenshots. They highlight projects with 1000+ stars, which saves time when you're looking for mature tools. 

The standout feature? Every 30 issues gets compiled into comprehensive e-book collections with seasonal reviews and curated compilations. These aren't just archives - they're well-organized reference materials that you can actually use for learning and project discovery.

It's a paid newsletter, but the current pricing seems reasonable for what you get.

## 2. Python Weekly

The OG Python newsletter with 700+ issues since 2012. Each week brings 11-15 articles/tutorials/talks and 9-12 projects, plus Python event listings.

The quality is inconsistent - some article descriptions are thoughtful, others are just copy-pasted excerpts. Project descriptions usually come straight from GitHub repos without much editorial input. But honestly? The consistency over 12+ years is impressive.

Respect to the creator for building something sustainable. They also run newsletters for other programming topics and entrepreneurship.

## 3. Pycoder's Weekly

Running since 2012 with 680+ issues, 171K subscribers, and 122K Twitter followers. Each issue has about 15 articles and 6 projects, plus Python events. There are usually 2-3 ads, but they're not too intrusive.

What I appreciate: They actually put effort into descriptions, include source credits, and mention where content comes from. They also feature reader submissions that you won't see elsewhere.

The Real Python connection means you'll sometimes get exclusive content from their educational platform.

## 4. Python Hub Weekly Digest

Been around since 2012, created by a developer from Ukraine. Each issue has about 11 articles and 8 projects.

I like their curation approach - they mix recent popular content with older stuff that other newsletters missed. Most articles get descriptions (usually excerpts), though they don't separate videos from articles, which can be confusing.

The design is clean and ad-free, which is refreshing. They've built a solid following with 145K Twitter followers.

## 5. Django News

Started in December 2019, focusing exclusively on Django: news, articles, projects, events, and jobs. With 4.2K subscribers, it's smaller than the general Python newsletters, but that's the point.

Interesting business model - they're transparent about ad pricing ($250 per spot, two spots per issue) and let you book online. Smart way to monetize a niche audience.

## 6. Python on Microcontrollers Newsletter

For Python + hardware folks, though the dark theme layout with lots of images can feel visually cluttered.

Despite the name, it's mostly about single-board computers like Raspberry Pi rather than actual microcontrollers. If you're into IoT or hardware projects, this covers a growing niche that most Python newsletters ignore.

## 7. This Week in Python

Started in March 2022 with a simple format: exactly 5 articles and 5 projects per issue. Used to have descriptions, now it's just titles and links. Content is decent but overlaps with other newsletters. No ads.

The creator seems genuinely enthusiastic and sometimes writes original content. Shows that you don't need fancy formatting to run a newsletter - just share what you're reading.

## 8. Python weekly newsletter

Quantity over quality here - just titles and links with comment counts, no descriptions. Warning: they sometimes include actual snake articles mixed with Python programming content. The author runs about 20 tech newsletters with automated aggregation.

Content comes from scraping Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter, and Mastodon based on engagement metrics. Quality varies wildly.

Upside: lots of content (25-30 items) with minimal ads.

## 9. Awesome Python Weekly

Running since 2016 with 10 articles and 5 projects per issue, reaching 19K subscribers. Just titles and links, no descriptions.

Why I'd skip it: They mix actual snake articles with Python programming content, which is confusing. Project links redirect through their site before going to GitHub, which is annoying. Plus, 3 ads per issue makes it the most ad-heavy newsletter here.

Credit where it's due - running 20 newsletters is quite the operation, even if the quality suffers.

That's my take on 9 Python newsletters, from excellent to questionable. üìä

Newsletters can be a good way to stay updated without spending hours browsing. The variety of approaches is interesting - some focus on automation and volume, others prioritize quality and stay ad-free, and a few are experimenting with paid models.

If you're looking to subscribe, I'd suggest picking 2-3 that match how you like to consume content. No need to overwhelm your inbox.

I'll probably write about more Python resources in the future. If this was useful, feel free to share it with other developers who might be interested.
