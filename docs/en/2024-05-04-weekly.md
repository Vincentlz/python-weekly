1„ÄÅ[Google Lays Off Python, Flutter, and Dart Teams Before Developer Conference](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/google-lays-off-staff-from-flutter-dart-python-weeks-before-its-developer-conference/)

This week's big news: Google laid off the Python language team. Although fewer than 10 people, it included several Python core developers and steering committee members, sparking intense discussion. Python was one of Google's most-used languages in the early days, but sadly its proportion has been decreasing.

2„ÄÅ[FastAPI Tips from a FastAPI Expert](https://github.com/Kludex/fastapi-tips)

This is a GitHub document collecting usage tips from a FastAPI Expert. Current content includes: installing uvloop and httptools, using async for instead of while True on WebSockets, ignoring WebSocketDisconnect exceptions, using HTTPX AsyncClient instead of TestClient, and more.

3„ÄÅ[PEP 686: Make UTF-8 Mode Default](https://peps.python.org/pep-0686/)

This PEP has been accepted and will be included in **Python 3.15** (yes, you read that right - about two and a half years from now). It proposes enabling UTF-8 mode by default. When enabled, text encoding for files, standard IO, and pipes will use UTF-8, making Python operations with them more convenient.

4„ÄÅ[Pydantic: Simplifying Data Validation in Python](https://realpython.com/python-pydantic/)

A comprehensive tutorial detailing the use of the Pydantic library. This library uses type hints to help you validate and serialize Python objects, making code more reliable, readable, concise, and easier to debug. It has rewritten core validation logic in Rust for exceptional performance.

5„ÄÅ[Best Practices for Configuration and Data I/O in Small to Medium Python Projects](https://yanh.tech/2024/04/best-practice-for-configuration-and-data-rw-in-small-and-medium-python-projects/)

What are the best practices for configuration file management and data I/O in Python projects? The article's main approach: use YAML files to record configuration and data class content, abstract dedicated configuration/data classes responsible for read/write operations. (Shared by @AlterNao1)

6„ÄÅ[Patching Requests for Fun and (Concurrent) Profit](https://blog.borrego.dev/entries/patching-requests-for-fun-and-concurrent-profit.html)

The author discovered that when making concurrent HTTPS requests with the requests library, enabling CA certificate verification takes 1-5 times longer than disabling it, mainly due to calling load_verify_locations(). The author submitted a PR to improve concurrent performance by avoiding reloading root certificates, and the article analyzes this issue.

7„ÄÅ[CPython JIT Internals: What Happens When Python Starts?](https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/cpython-runtime-internals)

Python 3.13 preview already includes a JIT compiler, but there's still limited information about it. The author plans to write a series of articles deeply analyzing Python JIT internals. This piece explains what happens in the CPython runtime before the JIT compiler starts.

8„ÄÅ[Sleepsort: Sorting While Threads Sleep](https://animeshchouhan.com/posts/sleepsort/)

Sleep sort is an interesting but impractical sorting algorithm, usually used for educational purposes. The article introduces what it is, the OS task scheduling process, and how to implement sleepsort using Python asyncio.

9„ÄÅ[Calculating œÄ Using Leibniz Formula in Python, JavaScript, and Ruby](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/leibniz-formula-for-pi)

The Leibniz formula is historically significant as one of the earliest infinite series expressions for œÄ. The article implements this formula's calculation in 3 languages, comparing performance between languages and across Python versions 3.8-3.12.

10„ÄÅ[10 Years of Python Conferences](https://treyhunner.com/2024/04/10-years-of-python-conferences/)

11„ÄÅ[Some Notes on For Loops](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/some-notes-on-for-loops/)

For loops are fundamental code structures in programming languages, but their current state and evolution across different languages is quite diverse. The author reflects on basic for loop formats, foreach/forstep syntax, expressiveness compared to while loops, and for loop extensions (map, reduce).

12„ÄÅ[7 Simple Habits of the Top 1% of Engineers](https://read.engineerscodex.com/p/7-simple-habits-of-the-top-1-of-engineers)

"10x engineers" represent an aspirational level - those whose productivity and impact far exceed their peers. The author believes these people have 7 important habits, including "code is written for humans, not computers," "use consistent standards," "write simple code," and more.
