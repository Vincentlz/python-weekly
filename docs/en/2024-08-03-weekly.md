Hey there, I'm Python Cat. Here I share quality Python, AI, and general tech content weekly, mostly in English. I also run a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/pythontrendingweekly) as a supplement, where I share even more diverse tech news. Feel free to follow!

This week I'm sharing 10 articles, 13 open-source projects, and 2 hot topics.

## [ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials](https://xiaobot.net/p/python_weekly)

1„ÄÅ[Building web apps with Vue and Django (2024) - The Ultimate Guide](https://dafoster.net/articles/2021/02/16/building-web-apps-with-vue-and-django-the-ultimate-guide/)

How can you efficiently combine Vue and Django, especially when small teams need to develop full-stack projects on a budget? The author focuses on scenarios where both frontend and backend services are deployed on a single server, covering topics like resource binding strategies, server-side rendering for SEO-friendly HTML, and client-side enhancement of dynamic HTML content.

2„ÄÅ[Visual Low/No Code Data Preparation and Analysis Web App Built with Pyodide and React](https://blog.pyodide.org/posts/pyodide-react-pandas-matplotlib-scikit/)

Straight from the official Pyodide blog, this showcases a web project that lets users work with pandas without any coding, while also supporting matplotlib plotting and scikit-learn for linear regression. The article breaks down some implementation details and demos the key features.

3„ÄÅ[The trouble with \_\_all\_\_](https://www.gauge.sh/blog/the-trouble-with-all)

Unlike Java and other languages that use public/private keywords to control class function visibility, Python uses \_\_all\_\_ to explicitly declare what can be exported - but it's not mandatory. The author points out the problems with this approach and shares a method to enforce that only \_\_all\_\_ declared content can be exported.

4„ÄÅ[Why does "python -m json" not work? Why is it "json.tool"? ](https://treyhunner.com/2024/08/why-does-python-m-json-not-work/)

"python -m json.tool xxx" is used to pretty-print JSON content in the command line, but why isn't this command simplified to "python -m json xxx"? The author digs into the history of the "-m" flag and the early development of the `json` library to solve this mystery.

5„ÄÅ[tea-tasting: a Python package for the statistical analysis of A/B tests](https://e10v.me/tea-tasting-analysis-of-experiments/)

The author open-sourced the tea-tasting library for statistical analysis of A/B tests. The article provides a detailed walkthrough of the library's features and basic usage.

6„ÄÅ[Asyncio Event Loop in Separate Thread - Super Fast Python](https://superfastpython.com/asyncio-event-loop-separate-thread)

Asyncio event loops typically run in the main thread, but they can also run in new threads or daemon threads. The article covers three methods for using asyncio event loops in separate threads.

7„ÄÅ[Instrumenting Python GIL with eBPF](https://coroot.com/blog/engineering/instrumenting-python-gil-with-ebpf/)

As we all know, Python's GIL limits the performance of multithreading and CPU-intensive tasks. But how do you measure the GIL's impact? This article uses eBPF to measure the time from acquiring to releasing the GIL lock, analyzing its timing distribution.

8„ÄÅ[Embedded Python: MicroPython Is Amazing](https://hackaday.com/2024/07/11/embedded-python-micropython-is-amazing/)

Not long ago, MicroPython celebrated its 11th birthday. The author, an early user and evangelist, explains why MicroPython is an incredibly valuable hacker tool.

9„ÄÅ[Tracing the evolution of a Python function with git log](https://nerderati.com/tracing-the-evolution-of-a-python-function-with-git-log/)

"git log" is the command for viewing repository commit history, but can you use it to see only the modification history of a specific function? The article introduces the usage of "git log -L :\<funcname\>:\<file\>", which lets you specifically track a function's evolution over time.

10„ÄÅ[OpenCV and the Wild Kingdom](https://scottsexton.co/post/opencv_wild_kingdom/)

The author used OpenCV to develop a motion detection program to monitor who was stealing their cat's food using thermal imaging. Haha, turns out the culprits were the neighbor's cat, opossums, and raccoons! (Imagine waking up to find your food bowl completely ransacked...)

## [ü•ÇDiscussions & Questions](https://xiaobot.net/p/python_weekly)

1„ÄÅ[Whatever happened to "explicit is better than implicit"? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1efrusl/whatever_happened_to_explicit_is_better_than/)

Hot Reddit thread. The author noticed that some popular libraries (FastAPI and PyTest) don't follow the "explicit is better than implicit" principle, instead using quite a bit of implicit behavior and hard-to-observe magic operations. Why is this happening? Is there something wrong with this principle?

2„ÄÅ[What are some unusual but useful Python libraries you've discovered? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1egg99j/what_are_some_unusual_but_useful_python_libraries/)

What new, interesting, lesser-known but practical Python libraries would you recommend? Our weekly has shared many, and there are tons in this thread too! (PS: The author also [asked the same question on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41116896))
