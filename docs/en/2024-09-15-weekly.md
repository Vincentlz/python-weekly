## [ü¶ÑArticles & Tutorials](https://xiaobot.net/p/python_weekly)

1„ÄÅ[It's time to stop using Python 3.8](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/stop-using-python-3.8/)

Python 3.8 was released in October 2019 and will reach End of Life this October. After that, even if security vulnerabilities are discovered, no more patches will be released! Many third-party libraries and frameworks will also stop supporting Python 3.8, so it's time to upgrade to a newer version. (Note: Python 3.13 is coming out next month - [when should you upgrade to Python 3.13?](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/upgrade-python-3.13/))

2„ÄÅ[Multiversion Python Thoughts](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/9/9/multiversion-python/)

How can a library depend on multiple versions of another library simultaneously, like pydantic 1.x and 2.x? The author explores this possibility and proposes an end-to-end solution, discussing the technical challenges that need to be addressed.

3„ÄÅ[Why I'm Switching to Polars?](https://arilamstein.com/blog/2024/09/04/why-im-switching-to-polars/)

The author decided to switch their Pandas projects to Polars. The article explains the reasoning: it's not because Polars is faster, but because its syntax is more intuitive and easier to remember and use. The article compares code for handling CSV files in Polars, Pandas, Tidyverse, and Base R.

4„ÄÅ[How We Made Notebooks Load 10 Times Faster?](https://www.singlestore.com/blog/how-we-made-notebooks-load-10-times-faster/)

The author's product embedded Jupyter iframes, which took a long time to load. By separating JupyterLab's UI from backend services, parallel loading, simulating static requests, and pre-rendering extension UIs, they achieved an 87% improvement.

5„ÄÅ[Asynchronous IO: the next billion-dollar mistake? ](https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/asynchronous-io-the-next-billion-dollar-mistake/)

The author raises a question: could asynchronous IO (non-blocking IO) be considered a "billion-dollar mistake"? In a parallel universe, if we had spent twenty years improving OS thread performance instead, would we have achieved better results?

6„ÄÅ[Building the Same App Using Various Web Frameworks](https://eugeneyan.com//writing/web-frameworks/)

What can we learn by building the same functionality with different web frameworks? The author experimented with FastAPI + Jinja + HTML + CSS + JavaScript, FastHTML, Next.JS, SvelteKit, and FastAPI + Svelte. FastHTML's performance was particularly impressive.

7„ÄÅ[How to build a movie recommendation app without the complexities of vector databases](https://blog.streamlit.io/how-to-recommendation-app-vector-database-weaviate/)

Weaviate is an AI-native database that simplifies the complexity of data storage, retrieval, and querying while integrating with AI models. The article shows how to use it with Streamlit to build a natural language movie recommendation app that supports keyword, semantic, and hybrid search modes.

8„ÄÅ[PyPI Proxying for Docker Builds](https://www.robopenguins.com/pypi-proxy/)

Can CI systems be improved by caching PyPI data locally? The author explores two approaches: mounting caches during builds and using the Proxpi proxy server. The article explains how to set up Proxpi using Docker and Docker Compose.

9„ÄÅ[Bitten by Unicode](https://pyatl.dev/2024/09/01/bitten-by-unicode/)

The author encountered a Unicode issue where hyphens visually resemble minus signs (HYPHEN-MINUS vs HYPHEN), causing negative amounts to be incorrectly parsed as positive when using hyphens. The article explains how to use the standard library `unicodedata` to identify and distinguish between these two symbols.

10„ÄÅ[ Rust for the small things? but what about Python?](https://dataengineeringcentral.substack.com/p/rust-for-the-small-things)

Rust is becoming increasingly popular for specific data engineering tasks, like Polars, but due to its verbose code, it doesn't match Python's simplicity and ease of use in many scenarios. The article provides simple code comparisons, showing Python's advantages in rapid development and prototyping.

11„ÄÅ[Go vs Python for Serverless: Performance, Cost, and Ease of Use](https://atakanerbas.com/programming/2024/08/29/go-vs-python-serverless.html)

Serverless allows developers to focus on building applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure. So how do Go and Python compare in serverless application development? The article compares them across three dimensions.

12„ÄÅ[Google Trends API alternative: Wikipedia Pageview Statistics](https://substack.com/@franz101/p-148522892)

Google Trends doesn't have an official Python API, and unofficial APIs aren't reliable, so the author sought alternatives to understand search and topic trends. The article introduces the use of Wikipedia-related APIs.
