# Python Trending Weekly #44: Mojo Goes Open Source This Week; AI Learns to Generate Music

Hey Python enthusiasts! üêç 

I'm your host, and this is where we share top-quality Python, AI, and tech content every week - mostly in English. This newsletter is open source, so feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/chinesehuazhou/python-weekly). We also have a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/pythontrendingweekly) as our supplement, sharing even more resources - definitely worth following!

**Special Note:** This week we're giving away 5 copies of "Illustrated Algorithms and Data Structures in Python" - details at the end!

## ü¶Ñ Articles & Tutorials

1„ÄÅ[The Montreal Effect: Why Programming Languages Need Style Czars](https://earthly.dev/blog/language-style-czar/)

Discusses the style diversity problem that programming languages face as they scale, introducing the concept of a "Language Style Czar." The author mentions that Scala is too flexible, C++ has old and new standards coexisting, and Python's PEP-8 hasn't kept up with the times, calling for someone in the community (like the language creator) to guide the development of unified style standards.

2„ÄÅ[Decentralized Edge Computing Platform](https://fission.codes/blog/functions-everywhere-only-once/)

Introduces "Everywhere Computer," which aims to distribute computing tasks across a broad open network including personal devices, other devices in LANs, cloud node clusters, etc. Shows how to write specific functions using Rust, JavaScript, and Python, and compile them into Wasm components.

3„ÄÅ[Designing a Pure Python Web Framework](https://reflex.dev/blog/2024-03-21-reflex-architecture/)

Reflex is a pure Python full-stack web framework (15K GitHub stars). Its author introduces Reflex's architecture, including implementation details and working principles of both frontend and backend.

4„ÄÅ[Fixing a Bug in PyPy's Incremental GC](https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/03/fixing-bug-incremental-gc.html)

The author spent nearly a year tracking down a strange and hard-to-reproduce bug in PyPy. The article describes the various debugging methods used, the cause of the bug, and other issues discovered during debugging. The fix has now been merged into PyPy's main branch.

5„ÄÅ[Reviving PyMiniRacer, V8 in Python](https://bpcreech.com/post/mini-racer/)

How do you run JavaScript in Python projects? PyMiniRacer is one approach, but the old project was unmaintained. The author took it over and made many updates. The article covers the changes in the new version and future plans.

6„ÄÅ[Data Communication Between Python and JavaScript](https://juejin.cn/post/7351690896918003775)

The article explains how to implement mutual calls between the two languages, enabling data transfer across language projects. Python calling JavaScript uses **pyjsparser** and **PyV8**, while the reverse uses **node-python**, WebSockets, and HTTP requests.

7„ÄÅ[A Better Python Cache Implementation for Slow Function Calls](https://docs.sweep.dev/blogs/file-cache)

Introduces a caching solution using files instead of memory, similar to `lru_cache`. It provides a `file_cache` decorator with the main advantage of persisting cache results. The article details the implementation code.

8„ÄÅ[Speed Up Django's collectstatic Command with Collectfasta](https://jasongi.com/2024/03/04/speed-up-djangos-collectstatic-command-with-collectfasta/)

Introduces a tool that can accelerate the execution speed of Django framework's `collectstatic` command, including how to install and configure it, and how to integrate it into Django projects to improve performance. Also provides performance improvement metrics and best practice recommendations.

9„ÄÅ[Distributed Coroutines in Python with Native Extensions and Dispatch](https://stealthrocket.tech/blog/distributed-coroutines-in-python/)

Distributed coroutines are functions that can be suspended, serialized, and resumed in another process. When combined with distributed schedulers (like Dispatch), they can simplify software creation. Python natively supports coroutines, but coroutines themselves cannot be serialized. The article explains how to solve this problem and how to handle non-serializable files and network handles, large objects, and global objects and code updates.

10„ÄÅ[The Wrong Way to Speed Up Your Code with Numba](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/slow-numba/)

If NumPy-based code is too slow, sometimes Numba can be used for acceleration. However, due to its type annotations and compilation options, incorrect usage can lead to slower performance. The article analyzes related issues and provides optimization recommendations.

11„ÄÅ[Optimizing Django's System Check Framework](https://adamj.eu/tech/2024/03/23/django-optimizing-system-checks/)

Django's **system check framework** is a built-in mechanism that automatically checks and reports potential configuration and application state issues when running Django commands. Through performance analysis and code review, the author discovered and implemented multiple optimization measures, improving example runtime by about 50%. These optimizations will be released in Django 5.1.

12„ÄÅ[Law of Large Numbers: Why Going to Casinos is a Bad Idea](https://easylang.dev/apps/tutorial_mcarlo.html)

The article uses data analysis methods (Monte Carlo method) to simulate coin flipping, roulette, lottery, and other games, finding that the probability of losing is very high. This teaches us a lesson that...
