1„ÄÅ[Recent Performance Improvements in Function Calls in CPython](https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/are-function-calls-still-slow-in-python)

What's the performance gap between calling built-in functions versus regular functions in Python? Does converting function calls to inline code provide improvements? What enhancements have been made to function calls since Python 3.10? This article dives deep into bytecode and Python interpreter source code to thoroughly answer performance questions related to function calls.
