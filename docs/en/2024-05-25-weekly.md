## ü¶Ñ Articles & Tutorials

1„ÄÅ[Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html)

This article from 2007 introduces and compares two implementations of regular expressions: traditional methods and Thompson NFA methods. The latter can be millions of times faster than traditional methods on certain tasks, but isn't as widely adopted. The author advocates for programming languages to switch to the latter approach. The author also wrote 3 more articles about regex, detailed at the end of this piece.

2„ÄÅ[How to Recover Deleted Source Code from Running Code in Memory?](https://gist.github.com/simonw/8aa492e59265c1a021f5c5618f9e6b12)

The author accidentally deleted local code and managed to recover it from a running Docker container. The libraries used were `pyrasite` and `uncompyle6`, and the article details the specific operational steps.

3„ÄÅ[PEP-667: Consistent Views of Namespaces](https://peps.python.org/pep-0667/)

This PEP is planned for inclusion in Python 3.13, with one of the authors being our domestic @Gaotian. In early Python, all namespaces were implemented using dictionaries, but later the function namespace implementation was changed for performance reasons, causing some weird bugs. This PEP proposes to keep all namespaces consistent again.

4„ÄÅ[Replacing pyinstaller with 100 Lines of Code](https://tushar.lol/post/packaged/)

The author developed a `packaged` project that can replace pyinstaller to package Python projects into executable files. The article introduces its iterative implementation process, with highlights including the use of [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone) and the special use of the self-extracting compression tool [makeself](https://github.com/megastep/makeself).

5„ÄÅ[py.space: Develop Python Apps Online for Free](https://jeff.glass/post/pyspace/)

`py.space` is a recently launched website that's a streamlined version of `Anvil`, allowing development of Python applications that run on the web. This tutorial demonstrates the basic functionality of the website.

6„ÄÅ[Statically Typed Functional Programming with Python 3.12](https://wickstrom.tech/2024-05-23-statically-typed-functional-programming-python-312.html)

The article uses Python 3.12's pattern matching, typing generics combined with data classes to implement functional programming-like features. Match-case usage scenarios are rare nowadays, and this article provides excellent examples.

7„ÄÅ[How to Dynamically Generate GitHub Profile README with Python?](https://tduyng.dev/blog/dynamic-github-profile-readme)

GitHub supports adding personal README files, and there are many open source projects that can help beautify our profiles. The author uses Python to scrape their own blog articles and uses GitHub Actions for dynamic updates. I'm planning to try this when I have time.

8„ÄÅ[Custom Linting with pyastgrep](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/pyastgrep-and-custom-linting/)

`pyastgrep` is a library developed by the author that can query specific Python syntax elements using XPath syntax. The article introduces how to use it for custom code checking, enforcing coding standards that other tools can't satisfy.

9„ÄÅ[Generating Code Snippet Images with pygments](https://www.mostlypython.com/generating-code-snippets/)

`pygments` is a library that can highlight code or text. To demonstrate code snippets during PyCon presentations, the author used this library to generate code images. The article covers the implementation process, advantages, and recommendations.

10„ÄÅ[Implementing Llama 3 with Pure NumPy](https://docs.likejazz.com/llama3.np/)

Llama 3 is currently a leader among open source large models. The article details the key components of this model and implements Llama 3 using pure NumPy without relying on deep learning frameworks.

11„ÄÅ[Who Owns the Code AI Writes for You?](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/15/ai_coding_complications/)

The article raises a currently unsolvable question. AI-assisted programming has emerged, and humans will increasingly rely on AI-completed code. So how should intellectual property rights for this code be determined? AI-generated portions are legally copyright-free, which could bring legal risks.

12„ÄÅ[Clever Code Is Probably the Worst Code You Could Write](https://read.engineerscode.com/p/clever-code-is-probably-the-worst)

Clever code is likely not clear code. The article advises against overusing flashy one-liner code. Code readability is crucial - the article distinguishes between good and bad code and provides suggestions for writing clear code.
