## ü¶Ñ Articles & Tutorials

1. [My Favorite Python 3.13 Feature](https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/my-favorite-python-3-dot-13-feature/)

Before Python 3.13 entered feature freeze, it added a brand new REPL, which the author says is his favorite feature in Python 3.13. The new REPL is truly impressive: colored prompts, automatic indentation on next line, tab auto-indents 4 spaces, exit and help no longer need parentheses, supports block-level history, supports pasting code blocks... These new features are exactly what I've been wanting, and they're finally coming! Unfortunately, it doesn't support Windows yet!

9. [100x Speedup with "Unsafe Python" for Numpy Code](https://yosefk.com/blog/a-100x-speedup-with-unsafe-python.html)

"Unsafe Python" refers to techniques that may lead to security risks or memory safety issues. The author uses pygame and OpenCV for image scaling tasks, discovering significant performance differences caused by numpy array memory layout (strides), ultimately improving performance by optimizing memory access patterns.

10. [Detailed Historical Evolution of Python Dictionaries](https://discuss.python.org/t/developing-a-detailed-historical-understanding-of-python-dict-implementations/52618)

This is a post on the Python Discuss forum where the author wants to organize the technical details and historical evolution of dictionaries, but discovers that dictionaries vary greatly across versions in slot numbers, expansion mechanisms, and initial sizes.

11. [Lessons Learned from Reinventing Python Notebooks](https://marimo.io/blog/lessons-learned)

marimo is a notebook product developed by the author, competing with Jupyter notebook, already used by institutions like Stanford University and BlackRock. The article introduces its three design principles: reproducible, maintainable, multipurpose, why these designs were adopted, and several lessons learned during implementation.

12. [Python Software Foundation News: Transparency Report for 2022 and 2023 Grant Programs](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/05/psf-grants-program-2022-2023.html)

PSF released a transparency report on its grant programs to the Python community for the past two years. Our weekly issue #30 shared an open letter from the Pan-African Python community questioning PSF's grant program. The report reveals various expenditures, trends, percentages, and particularly shares about several early grants in Africa.
